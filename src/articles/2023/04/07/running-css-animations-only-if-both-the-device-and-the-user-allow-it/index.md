Thanks to Chrome release notes, [I discovered today]({% link_to "notes/2023/04/07/1/" %}) that there is [an `update` media feature](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/update-frequency) which accepts values `fast`, `slow` and `print`, to set styles depending on the ability of the device to update the rendering and the speed of it.

As I'm already respecting the user's preference with the `prefers-reduced-motion` media feature, I wondered how I could progressively enhance this with the new media feature.

# "Testing" media feature support without `@supports`

[Amelia Bellamy-Royds](https://front-end.social/@AmeliaBR) had [the answer with a clever trick](https://front-end.social/@AmeliaBR/110158330793667431). Thanks Amelia! üôè

This is how you can apply styles only if a feature is supported by the browser:

```css
@media (thing: one), not (thing: one) {
  ‚Ä¶
}
```

Indeed:

- either the browser doesn't understand `thing: one` and ignores both media queries
- or the browser understands `thing: one` and this is either `true` or `false`, so combining both matches all supporting browsers/contexts

# Running CSS animations only if both the device (either `update: fast` not supported or `true`) and the user allow it (`prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`)

Combining this trick with my already existing media queries for the `prefers-reduced-motion` media feature requires a bit of code, but it's manageable.

Here's the code I got for the Ken Burns animations running on [my photography site](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo) (with non relevant selectors cleaned up):

```css
// Without @‚Äãmedia update support
// Enable animations if no reduced motion preference
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  img {
    animation-play-state: running;
  }
}

// With @‚Äãmedia update support
@media (update: fast), not (update: fast) {
  // If screen update is fast (neither slow nor print)
  @media (update: fast) {
    // Enable animations if no reduced motion preference
    @media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
      img {
        animation-play-state: running;
      }
    }
  }

  // If screen update is NOT fast (either slow or print)
  // Disable animations
  @media not (update: fast) {
    img {
      animation-play-state: paused;
    }
  }
}
```

Being able to nest media queries is great!

# Later update: a simpler solution thanks to Amelia

As [Amelia noticed when I shared this](https://front-end.social/@AmeliaBR/110160694917595587) (I ‚ù§Ô∏è her comment ‚Äúboth awesome & awful‚Äù üòÖ), the code can be much simpler, without media queries inception. üòÖ

Here's what [Amelia suggests to write](https://front-end.social/@AmeliaBR/110160702621003752), and I agree it's much better:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  img {
    animation-play-state: running;
    /* turn animations on if user doesn't mind */
  }
}
@media not (update: fast) {
  img {
    animation-play-state: paused;
    /* except, turn them off again if the browser can't draw them effectively anyway */
  }
}
```

I feel so lucky to regularly get great feedback from people with such expertise as Amelia, on many topics. [Once with Twitter, I now get this with Mastodon]({% link_to "how-tweetbot-died-and-lived-again" %}), and it feels even better.

Now‚Ä¶ how can I test the different permutations of `update` support or not, and actual value? ü§î
