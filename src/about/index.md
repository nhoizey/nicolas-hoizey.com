I am **passionate about [the Web](#i-love-the-web) and [photography](#i-love-photography)**, among [many interests](/tags/).

# I love the Web

I am passionate about the Web, which I discovered in 1996 during my graduate studies at [EISTI](https://www.eisti.fr/). I have therefore naturally created or participated in the creation of many sites over the years[^sites], so many pretexts to explore the technological innovations of Web standards.

[^sites]: I try to put back online all the old sites whose sources I have kept or found, like [Ciné Files](https://archives.nicolas-hoizey.com/1998-cine-files/) dating from 1998…

As a professional, I am **co-founder (in 2001) and director of innovation at [Clever Age](http://www.clever-age.com/)**, where I mainly advise on Web architecture (e-commerce, content management, collaborative tools, etc.) and *front end* expertise, including [Progressive Web Apps](/tags/pwa/), [Responsive Web Design](/tags/rwd/) and [Web Performance](/tags/webperf/). I also run some seminars and training courses on these topics.

A little (too?) curious and interested in everything about the Web, from knowledge of the lowest technical network and system layers (my specialization at EISTI) to quality *front end* integration including universal accessibility, I now call myself a **Web facilitator**, committed to sharing my knowledge with others, whether they are my clients, my colleagues or other members of the community.

Always concerned about quality, I participated in the community project [Opquast](https://www.opquast.com/en/), a quality repository for the Web. I also regularly participate, sometimes even as [a speaker](/talks/), in beautiful conferences such as [Paris Web](https://www.paris-web.fr/).

# I love photography

Outside the Web, I am also passionate about [photography](/tags/photography/). As a child, I observed my father using his film camera a lot, especially for landscape or family photos, and I quickly wanted to get started too.

I don't have a theme or subject that really stands out from the others in my photographic production, but I do have **a strong preference for the natural**, whether it's landscapes or urban landscapes, or portraits.

You can watch my photos in [my own photography portfolio](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo), but also [on Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nicolas-hoizey/).

At the end of 2014, I joined the [Photo Club de Draveil](http://photo-club-draveil.fr/), which was being created, and has since participated in several group exhibitions. This is a great opportunity to **confront his work to the eyes of complete strangers** (who are much less so now), which seems necessary to me to progress.

I also participated in the online photo magazine [Phototrend](http://phototrend.fr/author/nicolas-hoizey/), where I publish mainly hardware and software tests, but also news from the world of photography.
