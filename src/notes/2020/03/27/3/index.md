> `images-responsiver` is a simple solution for most responsive images needs

Is it catchy enough? 😁

Here's my latest pet project, trying to help people struggling with responsive images: https://nhoizey.github.io/images-responsiver/

If you use #Eleventy, there's also a plugin: https://github.com/nhoizey/eleventy-plugin-images-responsiver

Documentation is still a little rough around the edges, but should be enough at least for people already knowing npm and JS.
