Building a new site with [the beautiful Coniferous web font](https://ohnotype.co/fonts/coniferous) from @OHnoTypeCo and I can't find the right "web safe" fallback font to be able to optimize Cumulative Layout Shifts. 😭

![Coniferous and other fonts with default dimensions.](coniferous-and-other-fonts.png)

Any suggestion?
