I created a new page in [my photography site](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo) to show some statistics about the settings used to shoot the photos I share there: apertures, focal lengths, ISOs, shutter speeds.

<https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/statistics/>

Do you think any other statistics could be interesting?

This is of course using #Eleventy 's collections and filters, based on photo data stored in Markdown files.
