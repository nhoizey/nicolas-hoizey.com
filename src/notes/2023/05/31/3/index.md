General question about synthetic performance monitoring:

How do you define the device/network settings of your tests?

- Do you use low end devices / bad network to easily detect issues?
- Or do you try to be close to your RUM data, to have more predictability when you deploy changes?

I usualy do the former, but I think both could be useful.
