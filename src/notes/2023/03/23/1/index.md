Seriously, do we need [yet another version of Low Quality Image Placeholders](https://evanw.github.io/thumbhash/)?

Why do some people want to do additional work just to show useless colourful pixels to users, delaying the rendering of the actual image?

As a user, I hate LQIP. Single colour backgrounds are fine, though.
