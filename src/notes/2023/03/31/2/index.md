Is it ok to be proud to almost be in the top 25,000 of [The WebAIM Million](https://webaim.org/projects/million/), the 2023 report on the accessibility of the top 1,000,000 home pages? ☺️

With "Number of accessibility errors detected: 0", my personal site is [ranked #25,406 of the top 1,000,000 home pages](https://webaim.org/projects/million/lookup?domain=nicolas-hoizey.com).
