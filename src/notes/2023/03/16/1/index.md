TIL there are nullish coalescing [operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing) (`??`) and [assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Nullish_coalescing_assignment) (`??=`) in many programming languages, including JavaScript.

Never used them, always either using `||` or initialising variables with `undefined`.

Should I refactor? ðŸ¤”
