I have a client site with a header that is hidden when the user scrolls down, but shown again when the user scrolls up, which seems pretty comon nowadays.

This triggers some CLS, even if the hide/show is done in less than 500 ms, as “continuous interactions such as scrolls, drags, or pinch and zoom gestures are not considered ‘recent input’”. 😞
