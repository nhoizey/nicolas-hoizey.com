Year 2022: [the year of Container Queries](https://www.bram.us/2021/12/27/css-in-2022/#the-hotlist--container-queries)
Also 2022: [most people still don't understand `srcset-w`/`sizes`](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/media#sizes-accuracy)

How will they mix? They currently can't, as @SaraSoueidan explained: https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/component-level-art-direction-with-container-queries-and-picture/

Any other resource on the topic?
