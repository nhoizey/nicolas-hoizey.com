There are now 68 Twitter archives mapped in `tweetback-canonical`, which means links to the original tweets in other ttweetback archives are transformed to links to their archived versions! ðŸ’¾

https://github.com/tweetback/tweetback-canonical/blob/main/mapping.js

`tweetback-canonical` is a dependency of `tweetback`, so if you use tweetback and want to have all these mappings, you need to update your copy and rebuild your archives.
