Dear photographers using Adobe Lightroom, is there a way to search for photos based on the content of EXIF/IPTC fields that are not available in [the metadata filters of the Library Filter bar](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/finding-photos-catalog.html#find_photos_using_metadata_filters)?

I want to build a dynamic collection of images that don't have informations in [the recently supported alternative text field](https://www.iptc.org/std/photometadata/specification/IPTC-PhotoMetadata#alt-text-accessibility), for accessibility.
