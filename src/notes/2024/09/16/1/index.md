I have to admit that I'm often horrified when I read “Font Awesome” in the source code of projects I'm auditing for performance. Quite often, a fairly heavy font is loaded to display 3 or 4 icons, whereas [we've known for a long time that SVG is generally much more suitable]({% link_to "seriously-don-t-use-icon-fonts" %}).

But my growing interest in Web Components has prompted me to observe the arrival of [Web Awesome](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fontawesome/web-awesome), and my enduring admiration for @zachleat@zachleat.com and @leaverou@front-end.social (and their creations) means that their arrival at Font Awesome may well change my epidermal reaction to the name.

Bravo!
