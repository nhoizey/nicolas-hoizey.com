If you want to your #Wordpress content on #Mastodon, you can either

- use the https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/ plugin: “With the ActivityPub plugin installed, your WordPress blog itself function as a federated profile, along with profiles for each author”

- push the content to any existing Mastodon account by using my GitHub Action, with help from the new docs written by @Julianoe@mastodon.xyz : https://github.com/nhoizey/github-action-feed-to-mastodon/blob/main/docs/wordpress.md
