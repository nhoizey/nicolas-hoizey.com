Is it worth it maintaining a #TWA version of my responsive puzzle game **esviji** in Google Play Store?

Google requires periodic “artificial life support” to check the app is still relevant: API version update, [app links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links) from websites, developer account, etc.

The #PWA version has been available and installable on its own domain for years,
without any required maintenance:
