I added new ways to browse my photography website built with #Eleventy.

There were already galleries, like the list of countries I visited in Europe for example: https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/galleries/travels/europe/

Now, you can also see **all photos from Europe at once**, with 3 different sorting orders:
- [newest first](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/galleries/travels/europe/newest-first/)
- [oldest first](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/galleries/travels/europe/oldest-first/)
- [by popularity](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/galleries/travels/europe/by-popularity/) (a secret mix of favorites/likes from [Flickr](https://flickr.com/people/nicolas-hoizey/), [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.social/@nhoizey) and webmentions, and downloads from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@nhoizey))

Enjoy!
