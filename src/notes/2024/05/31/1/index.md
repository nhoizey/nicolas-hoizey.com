Please, please, pleaseâ€¦ check on the sites you build that using <kbd>Command</kbd>[command] + <kbd>click</kbd>[click] always opens links in a new tab, even if you used some JavaScript to build a dumb Web link!

[command]: <kbd>Command</kbd> on a Mac, but I guess <kbd>Control</kbd> on Windows and Linux?

[click]: Check the <kbd>click</kbd> both with mouses and trackpads!

I see too many sites where <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>click</kbd> opens the link in the current tab, so when browsing a list of links, if I want to open them in new tabs (for example to compare products), I need to use right click and then select the "open link in a new tab" option, for each link.

Really cumbersome! ðŸ˜¡
