> Alex […] shares how using CloudCannon for client sites boosts performance and efficiency 🚀

I love #CloudCannon's efficiency. 👍

But with an SSG, #WebPerf depends on the way you build pages. Good SSGs — as #Eleventy — don't force anything so performance is really just the result of developer's work.

The CMS should have no impact. 🤷‍♂️
