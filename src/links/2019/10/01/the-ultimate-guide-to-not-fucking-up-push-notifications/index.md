Awesome article about everything you have to take into consideration when planning to use Push notifications.

> For the sake of ** sick ** growth hacking, we got greedy. Website owners **now see push notifications as yet <mark>another way to force content down user’s throat</mark>, to increase page views and profit** […]. Don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with making money. But not at the expense of user’s experience.

> Many websites now ask permission for push notifications (and geolocation) directly on page load on first visit. And THAT’S the issue. <mark>Those sites are both greedy and lazy.</mark> Most users don’t not know about this particular site, the content, the value. Yet those sites want access to their notifications. They want their attention span and the authorisation to distract them, right here, right know. They don’t give users time to understand the value of their content. Of course, <mark>users are fed up with that</mark>.
