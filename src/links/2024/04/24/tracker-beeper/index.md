> A week ago, I finally got round to implementing an idea Iâ€™d been toying with for years: <mark>what if your computer made a little bit of noise every time it sent data to Google?</mark>

I installed it on my Mac with  instructions from [the GitHub page of the project](https://github.com/berthubert/googerteller?tab=readme-ov-file#readme):

```shell
brew tap robertjakub/teller
brew install --HEAD googerteller
```

Then ran it:

```shell
sudo tcpdump -nql | teller
```

This is mind blowing. Not in a good way.
