> Sometimes things change and your dumb old thoughts need to be buried so you can just move on and be you. Sometimes things that seemed so big and important for so long, aren't, actually. Sometimes it's nice to just reconcile with your past self and say, "You know what? Get out of the way. I know better now. Also quit being so fucking serious about shit that doesn't matter. You're making other people miserable. Grow up."

I don't plan to have tatoos or piercings. But I agree with Keenan: “Don't let the bastards tell you what to do with your body. [anyone] shouldn't have said anything; it was stupid and wrong.”
