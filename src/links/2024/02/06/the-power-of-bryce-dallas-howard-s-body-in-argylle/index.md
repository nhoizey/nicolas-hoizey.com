> A beautiful, smart, non-sample-size woman in a $200 million action movie by a major director should not be that rare in 2024, but it is. And it should also not feel like such a blow for rightsizing our attitude toward women’s bodies, but it does.

Bryce Dallas Howard is great.

Sam Rockwell is fine.

The other actors are… 🤷‍♂️

But [the Argylle movie is really bad](https://letterboxd.com/nhoizey/film/argylle/), far from the delight that were most previous Matthew Vaughn movies… 😞
