> Everything shared from my site to Mastodon runs out of a single [all activity RSS feed](https://coryd.dev/feeds/all). [â€¦] This feed is populated from a fairly verbose `processContent` collection. It also populates my sitemap and search index since there's plenty of overlap in format and the data being handled. *Anyways.*

> Syndicating this `all activity` feed is now being handled by a Cloudflare worker. The worker checks the feed every 15 minutes and once upon the completion of a build.
