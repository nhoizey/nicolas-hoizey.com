> The thing with switching to a new formatting context, as we do with flex and grid layouts, is that the minute you use `display: flex` or `display: grid`, <mark>a set of initial values get applied to the container and direct children</mark>. Those initial values should do something useful, or at least not do something weird.

I agree, I also prefer `display: masonry`.
