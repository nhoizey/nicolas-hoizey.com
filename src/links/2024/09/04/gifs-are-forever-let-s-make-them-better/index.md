Great talk by Tyler at CascadiaJS 2024!

If you prefer text over video, Tyler wrote earlier on CloudFour blog about most of this topic: [Is there a viable animated GIF alternative yet or what?]({% link_to "is-there-a-viable-animated-gif-alternative-yet-or-what" %})

And as you'll probably notice during the talk, Tyler and CloudFour love Cloudinary, so I must also remind you about this article I wrote 6 years ago: [Using Cloudinary to convert an animated GIF to a video]({% link_to "using-cloudinary-s-fetch-api-to-convert-an-animated-gif-to-a-video" %}).
