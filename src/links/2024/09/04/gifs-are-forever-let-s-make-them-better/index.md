> Everyone loves animated GIFs, right? Not if you have finite bandwidth, a shaky network connection or motion sensitivity! But fear not: <mark>Thanks to newly supported media formats, shiny new web standards and the magic of web components, there’s never been a better time to level up our GIF game!</mark>

Great talk by Tyler at CascadiaJS 2024!

If you prefer text over video, Tyler shared the full transcript bellow the video.

He also wrote earlier on CloudFour blog about most of this topic: [Is there a viable animated GIF alternative yet or what?]({% link_to "is-there-a-viable-animated-gif-alternative-yet-or-what" %})

And as you'll probably notice during the talk, Tyler and CloudFour love Cloudinary, so I must also remind you about this article I wrote 6 years ago: [Using Cloudinary to convert an animated GIF to a video]({% link_to "using-cloudinary-s-fetch-api-to-convert-an-animated-gif-to-a-video" %}).
