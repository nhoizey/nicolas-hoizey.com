> With the initial release of Speed Brain, we have designed a solution with important side effect prevention guardrails that completely removes the chance of *stale prefetch configuration*, and minimizes the risk of *incorrect prefetching*. This opinionated configuration is achieved by leveraging the document rules and eagerness settings from the Speculation Rules API.

Nice.
