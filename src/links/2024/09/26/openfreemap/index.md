> OpenFreeMap lets you <mark>display custom maps on your website and apps for free</mark>.
> 
> You can either self-host or use our public instance. Everything is **open-source**, including the full production setup — there’s no ‘open-core’ model here. Check out our [GitHub](https://github.com/hyperknot/openfreemap). The map data comes from OpenStreetMap.
> 
> Using our **public instance** is completely free: there are no limits on the number of map views or requests. There’s no registration, no user database, no API keys, and no cookies. <mark>We aim to cover the running costs of our public instance through donations</mark>.
