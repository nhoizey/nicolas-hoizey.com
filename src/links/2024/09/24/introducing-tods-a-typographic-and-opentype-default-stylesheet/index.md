> The idea is to set sensible typographic defaults for use on prose (a column of text), making particular use of the font features provided by OpenType. The main principle is that it can be used as starting point for all projects, so doesn't include design-specific aspects such as font choice, type scale or layout (including how you might like to set the line-length).

There are so many features in CSS, just for typography! üòç
