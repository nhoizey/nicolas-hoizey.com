> <mark>The axiom nudity = money, is very sick</mark> and I’m afraid this will have consequence with the time on many levels of our culture. And obviously, internet with this logic of censoring/making pay will ruin something in Arts, when free porn will remain out of control and available everywhere. It means that <mark>anyone will have more chance to meet nudity in raw porn stuff, rather than careful, respectful, sensitive and poetic form of art</mark>. I’m very sad about it.
