> Subsetting removes unused characters from a font to reduce file size. For example, you might not use math symbols like ≤ and ∫, and <mark>removing them could make your website load faster</mark>. However, **some type distributors impose licenses that restrict subsetting**. Use this website to find fonts that support subsetting.
