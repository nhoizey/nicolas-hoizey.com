> Be kind, be honest and engage on your own terms. Walk away from anything that doesn't serve you and don't be afraid to craft a browsing experience that best suits you. <mark>A healthier web is one that's slower, friendly and serves you</mark>. Eschew things that make demands of you, insist or impose upon your time and attention.
