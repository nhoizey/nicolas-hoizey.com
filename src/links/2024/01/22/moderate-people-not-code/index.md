> I love all this shared tooling for the same reason I like consent-based federation and communities over networks: it brings the moderation focus back to people, groups, and their behavior. Some of us want to connect far and wide, others want to lock it down and proceed with caution. Both are ok! In both cases, people and communities feel like the right units to work with.
