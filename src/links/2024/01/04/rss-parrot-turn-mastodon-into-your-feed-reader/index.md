> RSS Parrot, a Fediverse service that lets you turn Mastodon into your feed reader. The Parrot follows the RSS or Atom feeds of a large number of websites, and sends out a toot whenever a new post is published on one of them.
>
> Every feed has a dedicated account. If you follow that account, you'll receive a toot in your timeline whenever a new post shows up in the feed.
