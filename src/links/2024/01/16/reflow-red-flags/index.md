> WCAG refers to testing viewports at 320 px wide and 256 px high. They chose these dimensions in part because theyâ€™re equivalent to a midrange desktop resolution when zoomed to 400%. Whenever you need to dig deeper, you should view the same content on one or two laptops and browser-zoom levels to check the experience at 400%. This will help <mark>give you a sense of how users with low vision experience the content on similar devices</mark>.
