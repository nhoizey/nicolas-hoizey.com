> I wanna send $1 to a website, <mark>it happens instantly and anonymously, and the developer can do things around this</mark>. Like unlock features! For instance, stop showing ads, offer more complete downloads, unlock tutorial courses, etc. Make it **easier** and **faster** than using a credit card.

I liked [WebMonetization](/tags/webmonetization/) so much, and was disapointed when [Coil sunseted]({% link_to "coil-bids-farewell-but-not-goodbye" %}).

I too hope something standard and backed into browsers will come in the future, but I fear some browser vendors will try to take a commission, like app stores do.
