I keep sending people this clever solution provided by Hubert, I wonder why I still didn't add it to my links!

> ðŸ˜Ž No more layout shifts!
>
> Compared to the absolute position solution, we improved the situation:

> - No need to add a `.wrapper`
> - Would work fine with more than two panels
> - No need to assume which panel needs to guide the whole component size
