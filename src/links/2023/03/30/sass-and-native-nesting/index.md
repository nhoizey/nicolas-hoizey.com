> what will happen to Sass’s nesting? First of all, we won’t ever change existing valid Sass code so that it starts emitting CSS that’s incompatible with widely-used browsers. This means that even if we did decide to phase out Sass nesting and just emit plain CSS nesting instead, we wouldn’t do so until [98% of the global browser market share](https://github.com/sass/dart-sass#browser-compatibility) supported native nesting.
