> Algolia’s freemium journey has been heralded in the developer community for many years, and today we’re doubling down. We’ve replaced the Free plan with something even bigger and better: Algolia Build. <mark>New builders are now able to upload and index up to 1 Million records</mark>.

OMG, what an awesome news! 😍

I love Algolia, I've been using it for years for client projects[^fail] and [on my own blog archives]({% link_to "enhancing-archives-navigation-step-2" %}).

[^fail]: sometimes trying really hard without succeeding: [searching for multiple matches in a single item at once](https://discourse.algolia.com/t/searching-for-multiple-matches-in-a-single-item-at-once/13743)

Beeing able to have 1 million reccords instead of 10 thousand means I'll be able to index all my content, including my 10k+ bookmarks.
