> Unlike SPAs, HTMX **doesn't throw away the architectural approach of REST**; it augments the browser, **improving its hypermedia capabilities** and making it simpler to deliver a rich client experience without having to write much JavaScript if any at all.
> 
> You can use **whatever programming language you like** to deliver HTML, just like we used to. <mark>This means you can use battle-tested, mature tooling, using a "true RESTful" approach, resulting in a far more straightforward development approach with less accidental complexity.</mark>
> 
> HTMX allows you to design pages that fetch **fragments of HTML** from your server to update the user's page as needed without the annoying full-page load refresh.
