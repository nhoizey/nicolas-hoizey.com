> View Transitions for MPAs are a feature thatâ€™s high on my CSS wishlist, so I got to it. It took less than an hour to do, <mark>requires zero JavaScript, and two lines of CSS</mark>.

View Transitions are an awesome addition to the Web platform, I hope they'll soon be available in all browsers!

I would say they are even more useful in MPAs than in SPAs, where such transitions where already possible.
