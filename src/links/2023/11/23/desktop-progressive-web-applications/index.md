> Sit with that for a second, you can write a **desktop application** with **no tooling**, launch it **from your phone** to the internet **for free**, and seconds later **install it on any computer**. <mark>You don’t have to ask permission, or jump through any App Store hoops</mark>. I wrote a thing, pushed it to the internet, and then I could use the thing. Even better, I could send the link to Chris and he could use the thing. That’s the power of the internet.
