`sizes="auto"` is a great new feature of HTML for **lazy loaded** responsive images.

> are we dealing with an <img> with sizes=auto? Then its natural dimensions are 300Ã—150. NO EXCEPTIONS.

But this is not an issue, because you already have `width` and `height` attributes in your HTML, right?

Right?
