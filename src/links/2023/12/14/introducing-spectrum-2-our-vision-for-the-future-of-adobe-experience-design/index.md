> Because Adobe has products that span platforms (including macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and web), weâ€™ve had to think a lot about the right balance between cross-platform consistency (where users can learn to use a tool on one platform, then transfer that knowledge to another) while also adhering to the conventions of each platform. When Spectrum was first designed, mobile platforms were evolving rapidly and the user experience from app to app varied wildly between operating systems, so we initially leaned into making Spectrum as consistent as we could across platforms. <mark>Today, every platform has strong conventions that we want to follow more closely, so Spectrum 2 needs to supply specific variants for each.</mark>
