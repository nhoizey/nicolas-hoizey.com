> Reading the report, it’s clear that Netlify has a vested interest in elevating Astro because Astro is best poised to dethrone Next.js. If Astro wins, Netlify wins. Perhaps surprisingly I also believe that if Astro wins, Eleventy wins! It is *not* a zero-sum game and I know that 2022 Netlify [believed this](https://www.zachleat.com/web/jamstackconf-oss-panel/) (even if 2023 Netlify does not).
