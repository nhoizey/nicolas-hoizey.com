> The idea is that you, the poster, should <mark>post on a website that you own</mark>. Not an app that can go away and take all your posts with it, not a platform with ever-shifting rules and algorithms. *Your website*. But people who want to read or watch or listen to or look at your posts can do that almost anywhere because your content is syndicated to all those platforms.
