> My concern is that too many managers, bosses, stakeholders, and even testers, may do no more than run a free automated [accessibility testing] tool against a site or page and consider that sufficient. This post shows why it may not be sufficient. Bear in mind that manual testers are not free, so this is not a one-to-one comparison between humans and tools (nor should it be).
