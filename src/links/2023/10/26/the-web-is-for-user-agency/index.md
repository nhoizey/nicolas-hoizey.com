> Technologists trying to maximise user agency often fall into the trap of measuring agency by looking only at time saved (in the same way that they fail to understand what people *want* to do when they measure time spent). On the surface, the idea seems straightforward: spend less time on one thing, have more time for other things! That would seem to fit our mandate of improving "*What each person is able to do and to be*". And all other things being equal that can be true, but the devil is in the details: the enjoyment of doing the thing, the value in knowing how to do it, or the authority over outcomes.
