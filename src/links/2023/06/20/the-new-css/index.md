> This is the new CSS. <mark>The most powerful design tool for the Web ever.</mark> Only by using CSS, you can leverage what the platform is now capable of. Only by designing with the new CSS, you can create designs that flexibly adapt to different contexts and different types of content. Only by using the new CSS, you can build designs that are truly “of the Web”, materially honest, and elegantly efficient.
