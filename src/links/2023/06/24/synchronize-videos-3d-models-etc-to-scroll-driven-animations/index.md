> With [Scroll-Driven Animations](https://www.bram.us/2023/06/13/introducing-scroll-driven-animations-style/) it’s really easy to animate elements as they enter/exit/whatever. But what if you want to sync a video to that? Or maybe rotate a 3D-model as you scroll? With a little bit of JavaScript, it’s pretty easy to do so!

It currently requires Chrome Canary, but it's really promising! 😍
