Barry dives into data from HTTP Archive to show how Google's push for web performance with Core Web Vitals helped — or not 😅 — improve the performance of the Web.

> There have been lots of success stories which would suggest that yes it has, but this Christmas Grinch is less convinced…

I would like to thank Barry for adding [Speed Index in HTTP Archive reports](https://httparchive.org/reports/loading-speed#speedIndex), it's still one of my favorite metrics when I need to show something visual and easy to grasp to people without technical knowledge.
