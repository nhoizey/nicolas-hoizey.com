> The funny thing was, no matter who we talked to or who we read from, the unanimous message was: “We care very much about accessibility”. And yet, none of the CMSs were accessible.

Not funny, at all… but there's a "good" reason:

> We underestimate how much knowledge is needed to do accessibility properly. It can be hard for developers to understand the recommendations as they are dry, difficult to read, and difficult to understand.

Unfortunately…

> We are so quick to rush development and then move on to the next thing that <mark>we don’t even take the time to get the foundations right</mark> – including making our software accessible for users of assistive technologies. **As we keep rushing forward, we are leaving people behind.**
