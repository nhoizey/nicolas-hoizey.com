After [the link to Aral's post](/links/2020/03/25/apple-just-killed-offline-web-apps-while-purporting-to-protect-your-privacy-why-that-s-a-bad-thing-and-why-you-should-care/) yesterday, some details in this post from Jeremy Keith.

> This is not a minor change. <mark>This is a crippling attack on service workers</mark>, a technology specifically designed to improve the user experience for return visits, whether it’s through improved performance or offline access.

I love PWAs, I [teach how to build them](https://clever-institut.com/formations/pwa/), I [help companies decide](https://www.clever-age.com/fr/news/be-clever-meeting-pwa/) if that's the good option for their use cases, and I always struggle explaining how/why Apple is slow in adopting these technologies and user experiences. This won't help.
