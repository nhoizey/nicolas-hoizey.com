This is an excellent writeup of the different paths Bryan went to optimize the performance of his site built with Eleventy. I will definitely look for inspiration in this code.

> With so many cool things happening the JAMstack recently, I think <mark>we should always keep an eye on performance</mark>. Many frameworks can sacrifice speed for developer convenience. The ideas behind hydration and rehydration can sometimes negatively impact this as well. First render is quick, but first useful render can be tediously slow.

> I love that 11ty has decided to prominently call out sites that are doing well in this regard. It shows their goal of performant, HTML-driven sites.
