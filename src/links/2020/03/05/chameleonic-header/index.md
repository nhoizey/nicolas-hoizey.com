I remember seing a clever design years ago that had this effect on scroll, but it was just for a logo, with a single image.

Now that we have [`clip-path` in CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path), with [good support for the `<basic shape>` flavour](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-css_properties_clip-path_basic_shape), it can be used on any element.
