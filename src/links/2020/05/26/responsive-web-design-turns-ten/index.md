I remember being really excited when I read Ethan's [Responsive Web Design article on A List Apart](https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/) and saw the [final responsive result](https://alistapart.github.io/code-samples/responsive-web-design/ex/ex-site-FINAL.html).

10 years later, a lot have changed in Web pages layouts thanks to new capabilities in CSS with Flexbox and Grid, allowing us to design responsive sites without any Media Query:

But the most important part of Ethan's idea of Responsive Web Design is not about the technical implementation, it's about embracing the flexibility of the Web material.

> A light went off in my head. Responsive felt right for what I was trying to describe: layouts that would just know the best way to fit on a user’s screen. A user wouldn’t have to tap or click on anything to get the best design for their laptop or smartphone; rather, the design could fluidly adapt to the space available. It’d just respond.
