Sara shows us how to properly use SVG and CSS to design beautiful, engaging and accessible checkboxes and radio button in her new very detailed article, a must read.

I already new some of these, but I learned a lot more about people using touch based assistive technologies:

> When you hide an interactive element, make sure you choose a hiding technique that keeps it screen reader-accessible, position it on top of whatever is visually replacing it <mark>so that a user navigating by touch can find it where they expect to</mark>, and then make it transparent.

Thanks a lot Sara for the link to [Rob Dodson](https://robdodson.me/)'s great video:

Learning that up and down swipes change the navigation mode in TalkBack, I wonder if anyone already tried playing [esviji](https://play.esviji.com) with TalkBack, as up and down swipes are used to move the ball… 🤔
