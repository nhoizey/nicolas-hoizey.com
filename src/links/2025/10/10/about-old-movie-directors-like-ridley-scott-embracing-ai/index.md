> [jakehightower](https://www.reddit.com/user/jakehightower/): My working theory is that all these pro-AI octogenarian directors more or less already thought the VFX they’ve been using were generative AI and don’t functionally understand the difference. They just think the new stuff is more efficient.

> [Portatort](https://www.reddit.com/user/Portatort/): These directors already have a prompt engineering style relationship to visual effects in the first place. They review shots, give feedback new shots come back, they feedback etc etc

I think there are a lot of other jobs where this also happens, managers interacting with their teams like that, not knowing how the job is actually done, at all.
