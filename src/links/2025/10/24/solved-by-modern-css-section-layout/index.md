> In this article, I took a typical section design and made it more dynamic with container queries, has, clamp, and grid. Itâ€™s an example of the potential of modern CSS, and this was just one section.

Yet another awesome article from Ahmad showing actual useful usage of modern CSS. Let's hope people designing in Figma see this and understand why we need to design more in the browser, less in static tools.

Just a disclaimer: some of the features Ahmad shows don't work in Firefox yet, as it still doesn't support container style queries.
