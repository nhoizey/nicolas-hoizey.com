> Judging by what I see in the comments on the posts about Firefox’s potential AI feature integrations, the apparent path that critics are recommending as an alternative browser is “I’ll yell at you until you stop using ChatGPT”. Consider this post my official notice: that strategy hasn’t worked. And it is not going to work. The only thing that will work is to offer a better alternative to these users. That will involve [defining what an acceptably “good” alternative AI looks like](https://www.anildash.com/2025/05/02/what-would-good-ai-look-like), and then building and shipping it to these users, and convincing them to use it.

Anil Dash offers an interesting perspective on the positive impact Firefox could have on the use of AI, which gives me some food for thought, as someone who has been strongly opposed to the widespread use of generative AI from the beginning.
