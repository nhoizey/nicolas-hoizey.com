> it does seem as though we’ve collectively moved more and more toward artistic literalism, where anything not explicitly stated in the text by the author means that there was an oversight, rather than a choice. We’re quick to dismiss a character’s decision that we disagree with as merely “bad writing,” or an unanswered question as a “plot hole.” To me, <mark>that’s more often about our own unwillingness to do our part in engaging with the story, than a problem with the story itself.</mark>
