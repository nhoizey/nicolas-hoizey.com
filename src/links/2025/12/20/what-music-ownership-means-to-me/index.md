> Streaming as a way of playing music is fine. Streaming as a replacement for owning is what I don’t trust. At the end of the day it’s rented access, and the artists aren’t benefiting most of the time either. Stuff comes and goes. Tracks get greyed out. Albums dissapear. Licensing, regional, business, exclusivity deals. None of that has anything to do with the music itself.
