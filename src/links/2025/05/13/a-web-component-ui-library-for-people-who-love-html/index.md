> A lot of libraries approach Web Components with a *React mindset*, and treat them more like an implementation detail than a feature.
> 
> Instead of *leaning on HTML* to provide a baseline experience, styling it with CSS, and then enhancing it with JS when supported, they use JavaScript for everything.
