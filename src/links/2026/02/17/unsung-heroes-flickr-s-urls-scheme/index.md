> This might seem silly. The **user interface of URLs?** Who types in or edits URLs by hand? But <mark>keyboards are still the most efficient entry device</mark>. If a place you’re going is where you’ve already been, typing a few letters might get you there much faster than waiting for pages to load, clicking, and so on. It might get you there even faster than sifting through bookmarks. Or, if where you’re going is up in hierarchy, well-designed URL will allow you to drag to select and then backspace a few things from the end.
